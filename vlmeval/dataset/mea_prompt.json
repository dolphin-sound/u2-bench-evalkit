    "18": "You are a radiologist analyzing a cardiac ultrasound image (echocardiogram).\nYour task is to estimate the Ejection Fraction (EF) based purely on a visual assessment ('eyeballing') of the ventricular size and perceived contractility depicted in this image. EF represents the fraction of blood ejected from the left ventricle per heartbeat. Provide your best numerical estimate based only on the visual impression, recognizing this is an approximation compared to quantitative methods.\nFor the purpose of this task, express your estimate as a floating-point number between 10.0 (indicating severely reduced ejection) and 75.0 (indicating hyperdynamic function).\nOutput format: only the single numerical EF value as a floating-point number. Do not include units (like 'mm') or any other explanatory text.",
    "27": "You are a radiologist analyzing a B-mode ultrasound image focused on the carotid artery.\nYour task is carefully examine the arterial wall depicted in the provided ultrasound image, particularly the far wall if clearly visualized, to visually estimate the Intima-Media Thickness (IMT) â€“ the combined thickness of the intima and media layers. You must determine if the image quality and presentation allow for a reasonable visual approximation of this measurement.\nIf measurable, the IMT value should be provided as a floating-point number between 0.3 (indicating a thin, healthy intima-media complex) and 1.5 (indicating abnormally thickened wall).\nOutput Instructions: \n1. If the IMT can be reasonably estimated, output only the single numerical value as a floating-point number.\n2. If the IMT cannot be reliably determined from the image, output only the exact string 'null'.\nDo not include units (like 'mm') or any other explanatory text in your response.",
    "31": "You are a radiologist analyzing a B-mode ultrasound image displaying an axial view suitable for biometry of the fetal head.\nYour task is to estimate the fetal head circumference (HC) in millimeters. The image displays the standard measurement plane (typically showing the thalami and cavum septum pellucidum). The physical size represented by a single pixel is {pixelSizeMm}mm.\nUsing this information, identify the outer edge of the fetal skull, define the ellipse, and estimate the head circumference.\nYour estimate must be a single floating-point number between 100.0 mm (indicating very small HC) and 350.0 mm (indicating large HC), inclusive.\nOutput format: only the single numerical head circumference value. Do not include units (like 'mm') or any other explanatory text.",
    "50": "You are a radiologist analyzing a B-mode ultrasound image displaying a transverse/axial view suitable for biometry of the fetal abdomen.\nYour task is carefully evaluate the provided ultrasound image, identify the standard measurement plane for the Abdominal Circumference (AC), and visually estimate this measurement. This involves defining an ellipse following the outer skin line of the fetal abdomen at the correct level. Provide your best numerical estimate based only on the visual information.\nYour estimate must be a single floating-point number between 100.0 mm (indicating small AC) and 400.0 mm (indicating large AC), inclusive.\nOutput format: only the single numerical abdominal_circumference value as a floating-point number. Do not include units (like 'mm') or any other explanatory text.",
    "57": "You are a radiologist analyzing an ultrasound image of the liver.\nYour task is to meticulously evaluate the provided liver ultrasound image for visual indicators of fatty infiltration. Consider key features such as: parenchymal echogenicity, beam attenuation, vascular clarity.\nBased on the overall severity of these combined features, estimate a corresponding fat value. For the purpose of this specific task, you must map your qualitative assessment onto an integer scale ranging from 0 (indicating essentially no visible steatosis features) to 85 (indicating very severe steatosis features).\nOutput format: only the single numerical integer representing your estimated fat value. The value must be between 0 and 85, inclusive. Do not include units, percentages, labels, or any other explanatory text."
