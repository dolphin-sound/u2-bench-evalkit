•	'3' (Probably Benign): Findings have characteristic benign features but are not definitively benign (e.g., presumed fibroadenoma, complicated cyst). Very low likelihood of malignancy (<2%). Short-interval (e.g., 6-month) follow-up is typically recommended.
•	'4A' (Low Suspicion for Malignancy): Findings warrant biopsy but have a low probability of malignancy (>2% to ≤10%).
•	'4B' (Moderate Suspicion for Malignancy): Findings warrant biopsy with an intermediate probability of malignancy (>10% to ≤50%).
•	'4C' (High Suspicion for Malignancy): Findings warrant biopsy with a high probability of malignancy (>50% to <95%), without the classic features of Category 5.
•	'5' (Highly Suggestive of Malignancy): Findings have classic malignant features (e.g., irregular spiculated mass). Very high probability of malignancy (≥95%). Biopsy is required, and definitive action should be taken regardless of pathology results if discordant.
 Choose the single most appropriate BI-RADS assessment category from the options below.
options:  ['2', '3', '4A', '4B', '4C', '5']
Output format: only the exact text of the chosen option from the list above. Do not include any introductory phrases, explanations, numbering, or formatting.
